The&nbsp;Btech admission&nbsp;process is as follows:&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\tStudents who are interested in applying to the BTech degree program must take a variety of admission exams or tests, including&nbsp;JEE Main,&nbsp;JEE Advanced, BITSAT,&nbsp;WBJEE&nbsp;and AP EAMCET.\r\n\tThe institutes use these entrance exams to assist them enroll students based on merit. Individuals are chosen and put through additional screening procedures based on their performances in the aforementioned entrance exams before being admitted to the B Tech program.\r\n\r\n\r\nBTech Eligibility\r\n\r\nThe students who study PMS (physics, chemistry, mathematics) as their main subject are eligible for&nbsp;BTech Qualification. Because students from this background are slightly preferred, also, they have an advantage in the programme. Below, are the eligibility criteria mentioned:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tA student with a diploma in engineering domains is eligible to enroll in a Bachelor of Technology programme.\r\n\tThe students must qualify for their 10+2 examination from the science stream from any board.\r\n\tThe students must have secured 60% marks in their class 12.\r\n\tAlso, the BTech eligibility criteria can vary from institute to institute.\r\n\r\n\r\nTop BTech Entrance Examination\r\n\r\nSeveral institutions offer several exams to gain admission into&nbsp;BTech courses. Below, the exams are explained according to national, state, and institute-specific examinations.\r\n\r\nJEE Mains\r\n\r\nTo select and screen candidates for admission to B.Tech. programs at institutions like the National Institutes of Technology (NITs), Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs), and Government Funded Technical Institutes (GFTIs),&nbsp;JEE Main&nbsp;is a national engineering entrance exam. On the other hand, many public and private colleges also accept JEE Main scores for admission. The entrance exam for&nbsp;JEE Main&nbsp;also serves as a qualification test for JEE Advanced.\r\n\r\nJEE Advanced\r\n\r\nThe&nbsp;JEE Advanced&nbsp;is the screening test for applicants to the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). Those who rank in the top 2,50,000 in JEE Main can take&nbsp;JEE Advanced.\r\n\r\nWBJEE\r\n\r\nThe West Bengal Joint Admission Examinations Board (WBJEEB) oversees the&nbsp;WBJEE, a state-level entrance examination. It is held for students interested in being admitted into the undergraduate engineering courses provided by the participating institutes.\r\n\r\nBITSAT\r\n\r\nFor students interested in enrolling in B Tech programs offered at BITS Pilani and other campuses like BITS Goa and BITS Hyderabad, the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani administers the&nbsp;BITSAT, a university-level entrance exam.\r\n\r\nVITEEE\r\n\r\nThe Vellore College of Technology administers the&nbsp;VITEEE, a university-level entrance test, to candidates interested in enrolling in the B Tech programs offered at the Vellore and Chennai campuses of the college.

What criteria must applicants for B.Tech admissions meet?\r\n\r\n\r\nAns. For admission to the B.Tech program, students must pass the 10+2 qualifying test in PCM or PCB.\r\n\r\n\r\nQues. What is the IIT admissions procedure?\r\n\r\n\r\nAns. The students must take the JEE Main exam to be considered for IIT admissions. They will be eligible for JEE Advanced if they receive a qualifying score in JEE Main and place among the top 2,50,000 applicants. After passing JEE Advanced, individuals must participate in the Joint Seat Allocation Authority's (JoSAA's) shared counselling process. The availability of seats and the ranks attained will determine who gets admitted to IITs.\r\n\r\n\r\nQues. How many B.Tech specializations are there?\r\n\r\n\r\nAns. A wide range of specializations are available in B.Tech. During admissions, students must choose the one they like. Engineering specialities include electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, computer science engineering, and civil engineering.\r\n\r\n\r\nQues. What are a candidate's options after a B.Tech?\r\n\r\n\r\nAns. Students with a B.Tech degree have the option of starting their careers by working or continuing their education. They can finish their M.Tech or choose to get their MBA.\r\n\r\n\r\nQues. What is the full name of B Tech?\r\n\r\n\r\nAns. Bachelor of Technology, or B Tech, is the official name of this undergraduate engineering degree program. The BTech program lasts four years and is broken up into eight semesters.\r\n\r\n\r\nQues. What is the primary difference between a bachelor's in engineering and a bachelor's in technology?\r\n\r\n\r\nAns. In comparison to BTech degrees, bachelor of engineering courses are more theoretical in character. Regarding the course content and program approach, there are significant differences between these two-degree programs. While other engineering universities provide the well-liked BTech program, most of India's historic institutions, like the Indian Institute of Science, still offer the BE program. These two classes are regarded as being interchangeable. Therefore, many well-known universities provide BTech, while only a few colleges in India still offer the BE program.\r\n\r\n\r\nQues. What types of jobs are available to a BTech graduate?\r\n\r\n\r\nAns. An information security professional, data analyst, software developer, networking engineer, database administrator, testing engineer, and game developer are just a few of the employment opportunities available to CSE BTech graduates. Despite differences in nomenclature across different engineering specialities, technical and administrative positions can be broadly categorized into two categories. After completing the BTech program, candidates can pursue either of the jobs and build a successful career.\r\n\r\n\r\nQues. What qualifications are needed for a BTech?\r\n\r\n\r\nAns. The following skills are necessary for candidates to succeed in their BTech course. Look at this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAbility to communicate - verbal and written\r\n\tFamiliarity with Industry Standards\r\n\tKnowledge of the core subject\r\n\tTeamwork\r\n\tCreativity\r\n\tMulti-disciplinary exposure\r\n\tApplication of the knowledge\r\n\tLeadership Skills\r\n\tAnalytical &amp; Creative thinking\r\n\tAcquaintance with Computers &amp; IT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQues. What does a BTech engineer make on average in India?\r\n\r\n\r\nAns. A BTech graduate can expect to make between INR 15,000 and 30,000 per month as a newcomer. In other situations, a candidate's remuneration depends on the job description. A Project Engineer or Design Mechanical Engineer may expect to make between 1.5 and 8 lakhs per year on average. Candidates who have worked for companies for more than 4-6 years can expect to earn between 7 and 12 LPA. Professionals with mid-level entry-level positions have a better chance of making more money. Many professionals enrol in certification programs to advance their knowledge and skills and increase their income.\r\n\r\n\r\nQues. How many BTech semesters are there?\r\n\r\n\r\nAns. The BTech course has eight semesters and lasts four years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n","dateModified":"2023-09-06T12:31:44+05:30","datePublished":"2020-02-21T11:58:05+05:30","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Ishika Ray"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Collegedunia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","name":"Collegedunia","url":"https:\/\/assets.collegedunia.com\/public\/asset\/img\/cd_logo.png","height":600,"width":60}}}</script><script type="application/ld+json">{"@context":"https:\/\/schema.org","@type":"WebPage","breadcrumb":{"@type":"BreadcrumbList","itemListElement":[{"@type":"ListItem","position":1,"name":"Home","item":"https:\/\/collegedunia.com\/"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":2,"name":"Courses","item":"https:\/\/collegedunia.com\/courses"},{"@type":"ListItem","position":3,"name":"BE\/B.Tech","item":"https:\/\/collegedunia.com\/courses\/btech"}]}}</script><meta name="next-head-count" content="21"/><meta charSet="utf-8"/><link href="https://collegedunia.com/napi/" rel="preconnect"/><link href="https://collegedunia.com/napi/" rel="dns-prefetch"/><link href="https://collegedunia.com/web-api/" rel="preconnect"/><link href="https://collegedunia.com/web-api/" rel="dns-prefetch"/><link href="https://image-static.collegedunia.com/" rel="preconnect"/><link href="https://image-static.collegedunia.com/" rel="dns-prefetch"/><link href="https://assets.collegedunia.com/" rel="preconnect"/><link href="https://assets.collegedunia.com/" rel="dns-prefetch"/><link href="//www.google-analytics.com" rel="preconnect"/><link href="//www.googletagmanager.com" rel="preconnect"/><link href="//securepubads.g.doubleclick.net" rel="preconnect"/><link href="//www.google-analytics.com" rel="dns-prefetch"/><link href="//securepubads.g.doubleclick.net" rel="dns-prefetch"/><link href="//www.googletagmanager.com" rel="dns-prefetch"/><link href="https://image-static.collegedunia.com/public/asset/img/favicon.png" rel="icon" sizes="16x16" type="image/gif"/><link as="script" href="https://images.collegedunia.com/public/asset/js/polyfill.min.js" rel="preload"/><link as="script" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/postscribe/2.0.6/postscribe.min.js?v=2.0.6" rel="preload"/><script async="" src="https://images.collegedunia.com/public/asset/js/polyfill.min.js"></script><script async="" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/postscribe/2.0.6/postscribe.min.js?v=2.0.6"></script><script>

<h2 id="16">BTech: FAQs</h2>

<div id="faq_id">
<p class="accordio" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ques. What criteria must applicants for B.Tech admissions meet?</strong></p>

<div class="liv">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ans. </strong>For admission to the B.Tech program, students must pass the 10+2 qualifying test in PCM or PCB.</p>
</div>

<p class="accordio" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ques. What is the IIT admissions procedure?</strong></p>

<div class="liv">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ans. </strong>The students must take the JEE Main exam to be considered for IIT admissions. They will be eligible for JEE Advanced if they receive a qualifying score in JEE Main and place among the top 2,50,000 applicants. After passing JEE Advanced, individuals must participate in the Joint Seat Allocation Authority's (JoSAA's) shared counselling process. The availability of seats and the ranks attained will determine who gets admitted to IITs.</p>
</div>

<p class="accordio" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ques. How many B.Tech specializations are there?</strong></p>

<div class="liv">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ans.</strong> A wide range of specializations are available in B.Tech. During admissions, students must choose the one they like. Engineering specialities include electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, computer science engineering, and civil engineering.</p>
</div>

<p class="accordio" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ques. What are a candidate's options after a B.Tech?</strong></p>

<div class="liv">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ans.</strong> Students with a B.Tech degree have the option of starting their careers by working or continuing their education. They can finish their M.Tech or choose to get their MBA.</p>
</div>

<p class="accordio" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ques. What is the full name of B Tech?</strong></p>

<div class="liv">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ans. </strong>Bachelor of Technology, or B Tech, is the official name of this undergraduate engineering degree program. The BTech program lasts four years and is broken up into eight semesters.</p>
</div>

<p class="accordio" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ques. What is the primary difference between a bachelor's in engineering and a bachelor's in technology?</strong></p>

<div class="liv">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Ans.</strong> In comparison to BTech degrees, bachelor of engineering courses are more theoretical in character. Regarding the course content and program approach, there are significant differences between these two-degree programs. While other engineering universities provide the well-liked BTech program, most of India's historic institutions, like the Indian Institute of Science, still offer the BE program. These two classes are regarded as being interchangeable. Therefore, many well-known universities provide BTech, while only a few colleges in India still offer the BE program.</p>
</div>

What criteria must applicants for B.Tech admissions meet?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAns. For admission to the B.Tech program, students must pass the 10+2 qualifying test in PCM or PCB.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQues. What is the IIT admissions procedure?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAns. The students must take the JEE Main exam to be considered for IIT admissions. They will be eligible for JEE Advanced if they receive a qualifying score in JEE Main and place among the top 2,50,000 applicants. After passing JEE Advanced, individuals must participate in the Joint Seat Allocation Authority's (JoSAA's) shared counselling process. The availability of seats and the ranks attained will determine who gets admitted to IITs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQues. How many B.Tech specializations are there?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAns. A wide range of specializations are available in B.Tech. During admissions, students must choose the one they like. Engineering specialities include electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, computer science engineering, and civil engineering.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQues. What are a candidate's options after a B.Tech?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAns. Students with a B.Tech degree have the option of starting their careers by working or continuing their education. They can finish their M.Tech or choose to get their MBA.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQues. What is the full name of B Tech?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAns. Bachelor of Technology, or B Tech, is the official name of this undergraduate engineering degree program. The BTech program lasts four years and is broken up into eight semesters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQues. What is the primary difference between a bachelor's in engineering and a bachelor's in technology?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAns. In comparison to BTech degrees, bachelor of engineering courses are more theoretical in character. Regarding the course content and program approach, there are significant differences between these two-degree programs. While other engineering universities provide the well-liked BTech program, most of India's historic institutions, like the Indian Institute of Science, still offer the BE program. These two classes are regarded as being interchangeable. Therefore, many well-known universities provide BTech, while only a few colleges in India still offer the BE program.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQues. What types of jobs are available to a BTech graduate?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAns. An information security professional, data analyst, software developer, networking engineer, database administrator, testing engineer, and game developer are just a few of the employment opportunities available to CSE BTech graduates. Despite differences in nomenclature across different engineering specialities, technical and administrative positions can be broadly categorized into two categories. After completing the BTech program, candidates can pursue either of the jobs and build a successful career.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQues. What qualifications are needed for a BTech?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAns. The following skills are necessary for candidates to succeed in their BTech course. Look at this:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAbility to communicate - verbal and written\\r\\n\\tFamiliarity with Industry Standards\\r\\n\\tKnowledge of the core subject\\r\\n\\tTeamwork\\r\\n\\tCreativity\\r\\n\\tMulti-disciplinary exposure\\r\\n\\tApplication of the knowledge\\r\\n\\tLeadership Skills\\r\\n\\tAnalytical \u0026amp; Creative thinking\\r\\n\\tAcquaintance with Computers \u0026amp; IT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQues. What does a BTech engineer make on average in India?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAns. A BTech graduate can expect to make between INR 15,000 and 30,000 per month as a newcomer. In other situations, a candidate's remuneration depends on the job description. A Project Engineer or Design Mechanical Engineer may expect to make between 1.5 and 8 lakhs per year on average. Candidates who have worked for companies for more than 4-6 years can expect to earn between 7 and 12 LPA. Professionals with mid-level entry-level positions have a better chance of making more money. Many professionals enrol in certification programs to advance their knowledge and skills and increase their income.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQues. How many BTech semesters are there?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAns. The BTech course has eight semesters and lasts four years.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\",\"dateModified\":\"2023-09-06T12:31:44+05:30\",\"datePublished\":\"2020-02-21T11:58:05+05:30\",\"author\":{\"@type\":\"Person\",\"name\":\"Ishika Ray\"},\"publisher\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"Collegedunia\",\"logo\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"name\":\"Collegedunia\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/assets.collegedunia.com\\/public\\/asset\\/img\\/cd_logo.png\",\"height\":600,\"width\":60}}}","2":"{\"@context\":\"https:\\/\\/schema.org\",\"@type\":\"WebPage\",\"breadcrumb\":{\"@type\":\"BreadcrumbList\",\"itemListElement\":[{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":1,\"name\":\"Home\",\"item\":\"https:\\/\\/collegedunia.com\\/\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":2,\"name\":\"Courses\",\"item\":\"https:\\/\\/collegedunia.com\\/courses\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":3,\"name\":\"BE\\/B.Tech\",\"item\":\"https:\\/\\/collegedunia.com\\/courses\\/btech\"}]}}"},"metaData":{"title":"BTech: Courses, Admission, Eligibility, Syllabus, Colleges, Placement, Jobs","description":"B Tech full form Bachelor of Technology is a 4-year undergraduate engineering course that is available in several specializations such as BTech Computer Science, BTech IT, BTech Mechanical Engineering and others.

The\u0026nbsp;Btech admission\u0026nbsp;process is as follows:\u0026nbsp;\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tStudents who are interested in applying to the BTech degree program must take a variety of admission exams or tests, including\u0026nbsp;JEE Main,\u0026nbsp;JEE Advanced, BITSAT,\u0026nbsp;WBJEE\u0026nbsp;and AP EAMCET.\\r\\n\\tThe institutes use these entrance exams to assist them enroll students based on merit. Individuals are chosen and put through additional screening procedures based on their performances in the aforementioned entrance exams before being admitted to the B Tech program.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBTech Eligibility\\r\\n\\r\\nThe students who study PMS (physics, chemistry, mathematics) as their main subject are eligible for\u0026nbsp;BTech Qualification. Because students from this background are slightly preferred, also, they have an advantage in the programme. Below, are the eligibility criteria mentioned:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tA student with a diploma in engineering domains is eligible to enroll in a Bachelor of Technology programme.\\r\\n\\tThe students must qualify for their 10+2 examination from the science stream from any board.\\r\\n\\tThe students must have secured 60% marks in their class 12.\\r\\n\\tAlso, the BTech eligibility criteria can vary from institute to institute.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTop BTech Entrance Examination\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral institutions offer several exams to gain admission into\u0026nbsp;BTech courses. Below, the exams are explained according to national, state, and institute-specific examinations.\\r\\n\\r\\nJEE Mains\\r\\n\\r\\nTo select and screen candidates for admission to B.Tech. programs at institutions like the National Institutes of Technology (NITs), Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIITs), and Government Funded Technical Institutes (GFTIs),\u0026nbsp;JEE Main\u0026nbsp;is a national engineering entrance exam. On the other hand, many public and private colleges also accept JEE Main scores for admission. The entrance exam for\u0026nbsp;JEE Main\u0026nbsp;also serves as a qualification test for JEE Advanced.\\r\\n\\r\\nJEE Advanced\\r\\n\\r\\nThe\u0026nbsp;JEE Advanced\u0026nbsp;is the screening test for applicants to the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs).

What criteria must applicants for B.Tech admissions meet?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAns. For admission to the B.Tech program, students must pass the 10+2 qualifying test in PCM or PCB.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQues. What is the IIT admissions procedure?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAns. The students must take the JEE Main exam to be considered for IIT admissions. They will be eligible for JEE Advanced if they receive a qualifying score in JEE Main and place among the top 2,50,000 applicants. After passing JEE Advanced, individuals must participate in the Joint Seat Allocation Authority's (JoSAA's) shared counselling process. The availability of seats and the ranks attained will determine who gets admitted to IITs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQues. How many B.Tech specializations are there?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAns. A wide range of specializations are available in B.Tech. During admissions, students must choose the one they like. Engineering specialities include electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, computer science engineering, and civil engineering.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQues. What are a candidate's options after a B.Tech?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAns. Students with a B.Tech degree have the option of starting their careers by working or continuing their education. They can finish their M.Tech or choose to get their MBA.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQues. What is the full name of B Tech?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAns. Bachelor of Technology, or B Tech, is the official name of this undergraduate engineering degree program. The BTech program lasts four years and is broken up into eight semesters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQues. What is the primary difference between a bachelor's in engineering and a bachelor's in technology?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAns. In comparison to BTech degrees, bachelor of engineering courses are more theoretical in character. Regarding the course content and program approach, there are significant differences between these two-degree programs. While other engineering universities provide the well-liked BTech program, most of India's historic institutions, like the Indian Institute of Science, still offer the BE program. These two classes are regarded as being interchangeable. Therefore, many well-known universities provide BTech, while only a few colleges in India still offer the BE program.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQues. What types of jobs are available to a BTech graduate?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAns. An information security professional, data analyst, software developer, networking engineer, database administrator, testing engineer, and game developer are just a few of the employment opportunities available to CSE BTech graduates. Despite differences in nomenclature across different engineering specialities, technical and administrative positions can be broadly categorized into two categories. After completing the BTech program, candidates can pursue either of the jobs and build a successful career.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQues. What qualifications are needed for a BTech?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAns. The following skills are necessary for candidates to succeed in their BTech course. Look at this:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAbility to communicate - verbal and written\\r\\n\\tFamiliarity with Industry Standards\\r\\n\\tKnowledge of the core subject\\r\\n\\tTeamwork\\r\\n\\tCreativity\\r\\n\\tMulti-disciplinary exposure\\r\\n\\tApplication of the knowledge\\r\\n\\tLeadership Skills\\r\\n\\tAnalytical \u0026amp; Creative thinking\\r\\n\\tAcquaintance with Computers \u0026amp; IT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQues. What does a BTech engineer make on average in India?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAns. A BTech graduate can expect to make between INR 15,000 and 30,000 per month as a newcomer. In other situations, a candidate's remuneration depends on the job description. A Project Engineer or Design Mechanical Engineer may expect to make between 1.5 and 8 lakhs per year on average. Candidates who have worked for companies for more than 4-6 years can expect to earn between 7 and 12 LPA. Professionals with mid-level entry-level positions have a better chance of making more money. Many professionals enrol in certification programs to advance their knowledge and skills and increase their income.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQues. How many BTech semesters are there?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAns. The BTech course has eight semesters and lasts four years.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\",\"dateModified\":\"2023-09-06T12:31:44+05:30\",\"datePublished\":\"2020-02-21T11:58:05+05:30\",\"author\":{\"@type\":\"Person\",\"name\":\"Ishika Ray\"},\"publisher\":{\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"name\":\"Collegedunia\",\"logo\":{\"@type\":\"ImageObject\",\"name\":\"Collegedunia\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/assets.collegedunia.com\\/public\\/asset\\/img\\/cd_logo.png\",\"height\":600,\"width\":60}}}","2":"{\"@context\":\"https:\\/\\/schema.org\",\"@type\":\"WebPage\",\"breadcrumb\":{\"@type\":\"BreadcrumbList\",\"itemListElement\":[{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":1,\"name\":\"Home\",\"item\":\"https:\\/\\/collegedunia.com\\/\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":2,\"name\":\"Courses\",\"item\":\"https:\\/\\/collegedunia.com\\/courses\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":3,\"name\":\"BE\\/B.Tech\",\"item\":\"https:\\/\\/collegedunia.com\\/courses\\/btech\"}]}}"},"metaData":{"title":"BTech: Courses, Admission, Eligibility, Syllabus, Colleges, Placement, Jobs","description":"B Tech full form Bachelor of Technology is a 4-year undergraduate engineering course that is available in several specializations such as BTech Computer Science, BTech IT, BTech Mechanical Engineering and others.
